# Analysis-of-the-Mag-7-stocks-and-prediction-using-LSTM Method.
The Magnificent Seven (Mag 7) stocks are a group of high-performing and influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. The goal of this project is to develop a stock analysis and prediction system for the Mag 7 stocks using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. 
This project aims to provide accurate predictions of stock prices based on historical data, enabling investors to make informed decisions.


This repository contains the code and resources for building a stock analysis and prediction system for the Mag 7 stocks using the LSTM method.

Project Structure:

data_collection.py: Python script for collecting historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
data_preprocessing.py: Python script for cleaning and preprocessing the collected data.
exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for conducting exploratory data analysis on the stock price data.
lstm_model.py: Python script for implementing and training the LSTM model.
evaluation_metrics.py: Python script for evaluating the performance of the LSTM model.
prediction.py: Python script for making predictions on future stock prices using the trained model.
